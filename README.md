## Theme Structure

### Active Theme: `ui_suite_arsapps`

Custom subtheme of UI Suite USWDS providing:

- ARS-specific branding and styling
- USWDS component integration
- Custom Sass compilation with Gulp
- Federal accessibility compliance

**Location**: `/web/themes/custom/ui_suite_arsapps/`

### Theme Features

- **USWDS Integration**: Full U.S. Web Design System component library
- **Section 508 Compliance**: Built-in accessibility features
- **Component-Based**: Reusable UI patterns for consistent design
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, government-standard responsive layouts

## Group-Based Architecture

### Content Isolation Strategy

Each research group operates within isolated content spaces:

1. **Private Groups**: Content visible only to group members
2. **Public Groups**: Content viewable by all, editable by group members
3. **Mixed Visibility**: Granular control over individual content items
4. **Shared Resources**: Common content available across all groups

### Permission Flexibility

The flexible permissions system allows each group to configure:
- **View Permissions**: Public, authenticated users, or group members only
- **Edit Permissions**: Group administrators, content editors, or specific roles
- **Media Management**: Group-specific or shared media libraries
- **Menu Management**: Independent navigation structures per group

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. **Install Site from Configuration**

   ```bash
   drush site:install --existing-config
   ```

3. **Build Theme Assets**

   ```bash
   cd web/themes/custom/ui_suite_arsapps
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

### Configuration Management

- **Export Configuration**: `drush config:export -y`
- **Import Configuration**: `drush config:import -y`
- **Verify Changes**: `drush config:export --diff`

Configuration is stored in `/config/sync/` and version controlled.

### Code Quality

- **Coding Standards**: Drupal coding standards via `phpcs`
- **Static Analysis**: PHPStan for code quality checking
- **Testing**: PHPUnit for automated testing

**Quality Commands**:

```bash
# Check coding standards
phpcs

# Run static analysis
phpstan

# Run tests
phpunit --filter Test path/to/test
```

## Content Building

### USWDS Component System

Content editors can build rich, accessible layouts using:

- **Cards**: Information cards with headers, media, and actions
- **Accordions**: Expandable content sections
- **Alerts**: Status and notification messages
- **Hero Sections**: Featured content areas
- **Step Indicators**: Process and workflow guides
- **Collection Items**: Grouped content displays

### Paragraph Types Available

The following USWDS paragraph types are available for content building:

- `ui_suite_uswds_card`: Card components with optional media
- `ui_suite_uswds_card_group`: Collections of related cards
- `ui_suite_uswds_accordion`: Expandable content sections
- `ui_suite_uswds_hero`: Featured content with background images
- `ui_suite_uswds_alert`: Status messages and notifications

## Security & Compliance

### Section 508 Accessibility

- USWDS components are Section 508 compliant by design
- Automated accessibility testing integrated into build process
- Semantic HTML structure and ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

### Security Features

- Regular security updates via Composer
- Role-based access control
- Group-based content isolation
- Secure media handling
- Input sanitization and validation

## Group Architecture Decisions

### Group Types

The ARS Apps platform implements three distinct group types to accommodate varying research collaboration needs:

1. **Public Research Groups** - Open science initiatives with public content visibility
   - Anonymous users can view content but not contribute
   - Automated membership approval for authenticated USDA users
   - Full media capabilities for educational outreach

2. **Private Research Groups** - Restricted access for sensitive research
   - No anonymous access
   - Invitation-only membership
   - Audit trail for compliance
   - Limited to essential content types

3. **Hybrid Research Groups** - Mixed visibility requirements
   - Public face with private working areas
   - Per-content visibility controls
   - Membership by approval
   - Full content type flexibility

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Role Structure**: Leverages Group v3's flexible permissions with distinct Outsider/Insider/Individual scopes, synchronized with Drupal's authentication system.

**Content Strategy**: Article nodes for updates, Basic pages for static content, comprehensive media library integration for research materials.

**Security Model**: Defense-in-depth approach with private groups completely hidden from non-members, while public groups encourage open science collaboration.

**Administrative Oversight**: Global administrators maintain access across all groups for compliance and support, with granular permission delegation to group administrators.

**Field Architecture**: Consistent metadata across group types (PI, funding, dates) with type-specific additions (NDAs for private, ORCID for public).

This architecture supports USDA ARS's dual mandate of advancing agricultural science through collaboration while protecting sensitive research and industry partnerships.
